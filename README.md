# Comment_toxicity


I have developed a toxicity comment tracker utilizing deep learning techniques, wherein I've demonstrated the application of TensorFlow.
I have just trained the Neural network on 1 epoch due to my limited computational power, if you wish you can train on more epochs to achieve better results.
